It represents power, intelligence, and systems that think and move on their own. The gold isn't just decoration. It looks like polished circuitry, like the surface of a chip, because Argent Engine is built on technology, computation, and machine-driven design. At the center, the wings and body form a 3D cube, a nod to the engine itself - the foundation of worlds, physics, and game logic. It's the core of creation, structure, and simulation. So when you see the logo, you see two things at once: A soaring Argentavis, and the mechanical mind of an agentic AI-powered game engine. Natural power meets engineered intelligence - built to fly, built to build." />
